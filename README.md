# Machine Learning and Convulational Neural Networks using CalTech Pedestrians and YOLO v5 Model 🚗 🚷🚶‍♀️

## How to use our repository:

Our code runs on the CalTech Pedestrians Dataset, which is accessible at https://data.caltech.edu/records/f6rph-90m20. The files to download are data_and_labels.zip and CaltechPedestrians.zip. The data is provided in a pre-split format, with separate .seq files for training and testing, along
with corresponding annotation files in .vbb format.
